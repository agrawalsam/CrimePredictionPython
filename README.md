Read research paper properly to understand the code.

Download datasets, and change it into appropriate name. Import datasets properly. Dataset size is 10000. It can be increased or decreased accordingly. Larger Datasets give similar accuracy. So, size is made smaller for faster computation.  

Random Forest Algorithm is also added. For apriori to run uncomment the code lines. As they take lot of time, they are commented.
